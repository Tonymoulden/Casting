1 - What is output? What is an example of an output device?
we use print function to output data, an example of this would be print('this is output')

2 - What is input? What is an example of an input device?
it reads a line entered on/in the console by inputs, an example of this is input('enter symbol here: ')

3 - What function do we use to output to the user?
print

4 - What function do we use to get input to the user?
input

5 - What is the argument that input takes? Why is it important?
it takes actions, so that the user can enter the data on the console

6 - What data type does input return? What can we do to get different types of data?
string format, and yes like floats and ints

7 - Give an example of casting input to an integer.
int(input('enter a number: '))

8 - When might casting input from the user cause the program to crash?
I forgot but I know it when you have something repeated many times

9 - Can you use casting whenever you want?
yes

10 - How might you lose information if you cast to an integer, instead of a float?
because it'll round your decimal incorrectly so if you have 3.9999 it would round that to three
so to avoid that you could just int(round(3.9999))
